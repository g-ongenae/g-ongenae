### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Guillaume Ongenae, a developer, based in Paris, working most of the time with Typescript and NestJS.
Currently working as the lead backend developer at [Algoan](https://www.algoan.com),
a FinTech aiming to revolutionize the credits by making it more open and responsible thanks to the OpenBanking.
I'm also the maintainer of [@algoan/nestjs-components](https://github.com/algoan/nestjs-components/).

I like to create projects around languages and writing stories:

- _(archived)_ [Trunslutur](https://github.com/g-ongenae/trunslutur): Simple single page web app to make vowels transformation in a text.
- _(archived)_ [Writtter](https://github.com/g-ongenae/writtter): Simple platform to write and share stories
- _(archived)_ [Literature Mashup Bot](https://github.com/g-ongenae/litterature-mashup-bot): Twitter bot that creates mashup Gallimard covers from two French authors.
- Participation in the [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo): [2021 (incomplete)](https://github.com/g-ongenae/NaNoGenMo-2021), 2024 (TBD)

Or other domains:

- _(archived)_ [Days](https://github.com/g-ongenae/days): Everyday for three months, I was challenging myself by playing with front tech (HTML, CSS and canvas vanilla JS)
